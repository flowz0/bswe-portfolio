      <p className="text-p text-neutral-300 mt-4 lg:mt-0">
        I&apos;m a <strong>software engineer</strong> specializing in <strong>front-end development</strong> with a strong grasp of full-stack architecture and how each layer works together to create seamless digital experiences. I focus on building <strong>intuitive</strong>, <strong>responsive</strong>, and <strong>high-performance interfaces</strong> that balance design, functionality, and accessibility.
      </p>
      <p className="text-p text-neutral-300 mt-4">
        I approach every project with a <strong>user-centered mindset</strong>, turning complex requirements into <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong>, <strong>and maintainable solutions</strong>. While my passion is front-end architecture and user experience, I&apos;m equally comfortable designing and integrating <strong>back-end systems</strong> that power reliable, end-to-end applications.
      </p>
      <p className="text-p text-neutral-300 mt-4">
        I believe in writing <strong>thoughtful</strong>, <strong>well-tested code</strong> and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to build products that are <strong>performant</strong>, <strong>maintainable</strong>, <strong>and effortless to use</strong>.
