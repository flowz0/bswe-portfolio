      <p className="text-p text-neutral-300 mt-4 lg:mt-0">
        I&apos;m a software engineer who specializes in front-end development, with a strong understanding of the full stack and how every layer connects to deliver seamless digital experiences. My focus is on crafting intuitive, responsive, and high-performing user interfaces that balance design, functionality, and accessibility.
      </p>
      <p className="text-p text-neutral-300 mt-4">
        I approach every project with a user-centered mindset translating complex requirements into clean, maintainable, and scalable solutions. While my primary passion lies in front-end architecture and user experience, I&apos;m equally comfortable designing and implementing back-end systems to support robust, end-to-end applications.
      </p>
      <p className="text-p text-neutral-300 mt-4">
        I believe in writing thoughtful, well-tested code and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to build products that are reliable, performant, and easy to evolve. My goal is always to create interfaces that not only look great, but work flawlessly and make technology feel effortless.
